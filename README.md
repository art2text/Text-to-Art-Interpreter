Text-to-Art Interpreter
Version 1.0

Overview:
The Text-to-Art Interpreter allows anyone to convert a text file into a drawing. In seconds, you can now transform
famous literary texts, such as the Great Gatsby, or even writings of your own, into abstract works of art. The program
will automatically save your drawings in a 'Previous Drawings' menu, so you can compare drawings instantly or come back 
to old drawings weeks later. 

System Requirements:
1) Must have Python 2 or 3 installed (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2) Software has best support on Mac devices but should still be compatible with recent versions of Windows

Running the Program:
1) Navigate to the 'SourceCode' directory
2) Run main.py
3) Inside the GUI, click the 'Open New Text File' button
4) Browse the TestFiles directory we provided in the package and select a valid file such as greatgatsby.txt
5) Click the 'Draw Text File' button to see the text file's drawing
